# Getting-Down
This is a simple game that I used to play on a NOKIA phone when I was a child.
After ten days of python learning, I decided to program this game on my own. At the mean time, I have added a few new features to this game, which may make it more interesting.
The source code is in Script.py
The exe file is included in the file "dist"
