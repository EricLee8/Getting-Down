# Getting-Down
This is a simple game that I used to play on a NOKIA phone when I was a child.
After ten days of python learning, I decided to program this game on my own. At the mean time, I have added a few new features to this game, which may make it more interesting.
The source code is in Script.py
The exe file is included in the file "dist"
P.S. If you want to play this game, you can download dist.zip and run the .exe inside it.
